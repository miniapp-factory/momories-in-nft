+1. The Name"Omni-Gotchi"(Derived from "Omnichain" and "Tamagotchi")2. The Idea: What & HowThe Core Concept:A high-stakes digital pet that lives on a secure "Home Chain" (Ethereum Sepolia) but must be fed and cared for from cheaper "Resource Chains" (Arbitrum Sepolia, Base Sepolia, etc.).How it Functions:The Pet (L1): The Pet is an ERC-721 NFT fully stored on-chain. Its appearance is generated dynamically via SVG code inside the smart contract. It has state variables: Hunger, Happiness, and Level.The Decay: Every block, the Pet's Hunger increases. If Hunger hits 100, the SVG changes to a "Ghost" (Death).The Food (L2): Users cannot interact directly with the L1 contract (too expensive). Instead, they go to L2 (Arbitrum) and mint/buy "Food Tokens" (ERC-1155).The Bridge: When a user "feeds" the pet on L2, the contract burns the Food Token and sends a Cross-Chain Message to L1.The Update: The L1 contract receives the message, verifies it came from the L2 Food Shop, and lowers the Pet's hunger.3.

Plan: How to Build (Step-by-Step)This project requires distinct phases. Do not try to build everything at once.Phase 1: The "Local" Pet (Solidity)Goal: Build the Pet contract on a single chain first.Setup: Initialize a new Foundry project (forge init).State Logic: Create a struct Pet { uint256 hunger; uint256 lastFed; }. Write a function calculateHunger() that uses block.timestamp to determine current hunger.SVG Engine: Write a pure function renderSVG(uint256 hunger) that returns a string.If hunger < 50: Return an SVG string of a happy face.If hunger > 50: Return an SVG string of a sad face.NFT Contract: Wrap this in an ERC-721. The tokenURI function should call renderSVG and return a base64 encoded JSON.Phase 2: The Cross-Chain Messaging (LayerZero)Goal: Connect two contracts on different chains.Install LayerZero: Add the LayerZero dependencies to your Foundry project.L1 Receiver (Pet): Inherit OAppReceiver. Implement the _lzReceive function. This function should:Decode the payload (e.g., abi.decode(payload, (petId, foodValue))).Update the Pet's hunger.L2 Sender (Food): Create a simple contract that accepts payment. Implement _lzSend.This function constructs the payload and pays the cross-chain gas fee.Mock Testing: Use LZEndpointMock in Foundry to simulate a message going from Chain A to Chain B in your unit tests. Do not skip this. Debugging cross-chain on live testnets is painful.Phase 3: The "Food" Economy (ERC-1155)Goal: Add the payment/item logic.Food Token: Create an ERC-1155 contract on L2.ID 0 = Apple (Restores 10 Hunger).ID 1 = Steak (Restores 50 Hunger).Integration: Modify the L2 Sender contract. It should require the user to burn an ERC-1155 token before it triggers the _lzSend message.Phase 4: Frontend & DeploymentGoal: Connect the user interface.Deploy: Deploy "Pet" to Sepolia (L1) and "FoodShop" to Arbitrum Sepolia (L2).Wire LayerZero: You must call setPeer on both contracts so they know each other's addresses.UI Build:Page 1 (The Pet): Fetches the NFT data from Sepolia and renders the SVG image. Shows a "Hunger Bar."Page 2 (The Shop): Connects to Arbitrum. Allows user to "Buy Food" and "Feed Pet."UX Polish: Add a "loading" state. Cross-chain messages take ~1 minute. Show a "Message In Flight..." spinner so the user knows it's working.
